# OLOPA - Web3 Freelance Escrow MVP

## Overview

OLOPA is a Web3 freelance escrow platform MVP built with React, Vite, and Solana integration. The platform enables users to create freelance contracts, manage deals, and integrate with Phantom wallet for blockchain connectivity. This is a clean, functional, deployment-ready MVP focused on frontend functionality without blockchain logic implementation.

## User Preferences

- Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language
- Focus on speed, responsiveness, and clean code
- Deployment target: Netlify
- Priority: Working wallet connect/disconnect, responsive design, deploy-ready build

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with Vite 5 build tool
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **State Management**: Component state with React hooks + localStorage for persistence
- **Pages**: Home, CreateContract, MyDeals
- **Components**: Header with wallet integration

### Blockchain Integration
- **Network**: Solana Devnet for testing
- **Wallet**: Phantom wallet integration with full connect/disconnect
- **Connection Management**: Connect/disconnect with localStorage state persistence
- **Escrow System**: Real on-chain escrow accounts for holding SOL
- **Transactions**: Actual blockchain transactions for funding and releasing funds
- **Auto-reconnect Prevention**: localStorage flag prevents unwanted auto-connections

### Data Storage Strategy
- **LocalStorage**: Contract data, wallet disconnect state, escrow keypairs
- **Format**: JSON serialization for contract objects
- **Security Note**: Escrow private keys stored in localStorage (MVP only, not production-safe)
- **Blockchain**: Actual escrow accounts created on Solana devnet
